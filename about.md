# YearnfulPracticeMode
Places <cj>Practice Mode</c> <c-00FF00>checkpoints</c> during <cg>Normal Mode</c> to make <c-00ff00>enabling</c> <cj>Practice Mode</c> a bit smoother. Also comes with an additional option to <c-00ff00>auto-enable</c> <cj>Practice Mode</c> on player death.

*<cy>Note: the checkpoint placement algorithm is* **_not_** *a 1:1 recreation of how RobTop's auto-checkpoint system works. This is because a 1:1 re-creation of RobTop's auto-checkpoint system is beyond the scope of this mod.</c>*

<cy>The "Auto Checkpoints" vanilla in-game setting is not required for this mod.</c><cy>Your "Auto Retry" preferences from the vanilla in-game settings are ignored when deciding to enable Practice Mode.</c>
